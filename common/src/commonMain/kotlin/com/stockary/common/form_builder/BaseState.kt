 * This is the abstract base state that defines the basic behaviour for all form states.

 * @param initial the initial value/state of the class.
 * @param name this is the name of the state. It is used to access the state when required in the form. It is also used when creating the class in the [getData] method of the [FormState] class.
 * @param transform this function is used to change the data type in the field state. You can use it to convert the data in the field to your preferred type e.g [String] to [Int]
 * @param validators this is the list of [Validators] that are used to validate the field state. By default most states will have an empty list. You can override this and provide your own list of validators.
